# SearchSLCM

UPDATE: Doesn't work anymore since they changed the login framework for the hostel page on the website.

A quick search engine for SLCM
Student Data available-
1)Roll number
2)Name
3)Hostel
4)Mess Dues

It has two modes, 
-Induvidual search 
-Group search

Group search lets you save a group of roll numbers into a txt file, after defining the start roll number and amount of roll numbers needed.

It skips roll numbers on which no student data exists....
